with RAIDAtech Virtual Currency</h3>
          <p class="animation" data-animation="fadeInUp" data-animation-delay="0.2s">
            RAIDAtech Virtual Currency technology is a new approach that solves three of the most critical problems in the packaging and branding industries:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customer Engagement</li>
            <li>Anti-Counterfeiting/ Authentication</li>
            <li>Environmental Stewardship</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These apparently disparate challenges all relate to a fundamental challenge that every brand needs to consider - managing customer perception and using those perceptions to drive customer engagement.</p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Engagement:</b> How can brands get millennials to tune in, interact, become part of their customer family and extend that engagement for a lifetime?</li>
            <li><b>Security:</b> How can brands stop counterfeiting of brand products using authentication technologies at an affordable price?</li>
            <li><b>Stewardship:</b> How can brands reduce their carbon footprint and attract customers concerned about sustainability?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>While these appear to be distinct problems, there is a next-generation solution.  It is based on a new, provisionally-patented virtual currency technology that leverages many benefits of blockchain technology, without blockchain's limitations. </p>

          <p>Most brand executives are likely familiar with blockchain, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but these have fundamental problems:</p>

          <ul class="negg">
            <li>They require huge amounts of electricity to operate (very expensive).</li>
            <li>They require accounts on a public ledger (a barrier for many).</li>
            <li>Transactions lack privacy (a concern of many and a legal issue in many jurisdictions).</li>
            <li>Most importantly, they are very complicated to purchase and use.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Solution: RAIDAtech Virtual Currency Technology</h3>

          <h3>Benefits to brand</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>The brand (or packaging supplier) embeds the virtual currency on its packaging/products.</li>
            <li>Customers that purchase the product receive the virtual currency with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Customers use the virtual currency to validate the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li>The currency provides financial incentives for the customer to authenticate the product via the brand web site or apps.</li>
            <li>Customers now know the product is authentic.</li>
            <li>This process triggers a customer engagement process that can include additional customer engagement such as loyalty programs, games, collectibles, etc.</li>
            <li>Customers have financial incentives to receive the currency and engage with the brand.</li>
            <li>In addition to driving "eyes on the brand", customers can redeem the currency or hold it as it goes up in value.</li>
            <li>Brands can setup a rewards system that accepts the currency it places on its products.</li>
            <li>Other people can use this currency anywhere else, making it more valuable. People will buy more of the brand's products so they can use the currency to buy other items.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Additional Engagement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The currency can increase in value because it has a fixed supply in the market. Customers will track the price and treat it like an investment, all the while being "invested" in the brand. The engagement model is enhanced as the customer engages with the brand and products daily by looking at the trading price of the brand's currency.</li>
            <li>Brand stores or its retailer scan sell exclusive goods that available to engaged customers.</li>
            <li>Customers can earn status in loyalty programs by purchasing collateral products that psychologically connect them to the brand.</li>
            <li>Customers can join loyalty groups, subscribe to newsletters, engage with each other on social media or in virtual space (branded virtual reality events).</li>
            <li>Customers can trade brand currency without the brand needing to be responsible for its creation or administration.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Expanding Commercial Use to Extend the Commercial Relationship</h3>
          <p>Here are some other compelling ways that RAIDA Virtual Currency Technology can be used:</p>
          <ul>

These items can be attached to the digital currency and the customer can download them from the brand's web site. The brand can sell those collectibles or use to incentivize purchases.</li>
            <li>Gamification: The brand can issue conduct unique games and contests, such as bingo cards, that would prompts engagement with the brand while the brand is assured the game pieces or coupons cannot be counterfeited.</li>
            <li>Customers can use the brand's digital currency like an ID card that allows them to visit the brand's virtual worlds and interact with other fans. It's like being at a bar in your home. There could be celebrity there performing and meeting with people.</li>
          </ul>
